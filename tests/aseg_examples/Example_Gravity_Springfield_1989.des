COMM General Grid Based Gravity Survey Procedures
COMM ---------------------------------------------
COMM Subsequent to assessment of access, terrain & traversing conditions, a survey & gravity base location is chosen to facilitate ease of data collection within constraints of general operation specs (GA).
COMM 
COMM A survey mark is placed & static dual frequency GPS data is collected. This is either used for ties to existing survey control or submitted for external processing by either AUSPOS (GA) or TRX (Trimble).
COMM 
COMM The resultant coordinates are then used as survey seeding for control in subsequent station point pickups throughout the gravity survey using a pair of dual frequency GPS/Glonass receivers per RTK methods.

COMM General Gravity Data Collection
COMM ---------------------------------------------
COMM Gravity is observed by collecting instrument readings with a LaCoste & Romberg G model meter.
COMM 
COMM Daily procedures commence with a check/adjust of the reading line at a repeat station, normally the local base nearest station to the access, camp or GPS Base receiver.
COMM 
COMM Instrument readings are collected & logged manually via GIS input into the GPS Data Logger (Trimble TSC2) in conjunction with station positional data.
COMM 
COMM Subsequent readings are collected at stations on traverses looped & tied on repeat stations commencing with the local base.
COMM 
COMM Local Gravity Bases are tied out to the AFGN Network.

COMM Gravity Processing
COMM ---------------------------------------------
COMM Collected survey & gravity data is processed in Trimble TBC.
COMM 
COMM The data is then reduced to observed gravity by Strider Gravred.
COMM 
COMM The reduced gravity is then Bouguer Reduced per Strider Bouguer.
COMM 
COMM Daily data is reviewed to check quality & compliance to general GA specs.
